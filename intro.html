    Database Management System <br><br>

    Database management system is a software which is used to manage the database. For example: <br> 
    MySQL, Oracle, etc are a very popular commercial database which is used in different applications. <br><br>


    DBMS provides an interface to perform various operations like database creation, storing data in <br>
    it, updating data, creating a table in the database and a lot more. <br><br>


    It provides protection and security to the database. In the case of multiple users, it also maintains <br>
    data constitancy. <br><br><br><br>

    DBMS allows users the following tasks : <br><br>
    <ol>
      <li>Data Definition: It is used for creation, modification, and removal of definition that defines the <br>
         organization of data in the database.</li><br>
      <li>Data Updation: It is used for the insertion, modification, and deletion of the actual data <br>
         in the database.
      </li><br>
      <li>Data Retrieval: It is used to retrieve the data from the database which can be used by <br>
         applications for various purposes.
      </li><br>
      <li>User Administration: It is used for registering and monitoring users, maintain data integrity, <br>
         enforcing data security, dealing with concurrency control, monitoring performance and recovering <br>
          information corrupted by unexpected failure.
      </li>
    </ol><br><br><br><br>

    Characteristics of DBMS <br><br>

    <ol>
       <li>It uses a digital repository established on a server to store and manage the information.</li><br>
       <li>It can provide a clear and logical view of the process that manipulates data.</li><br>
       <li>DBMS contains automatic backup and recovery procedures.</li><br>
       <li>It contains ACID properties which maintain data in a healthy state in case of failure.</li><br>
       <li>It can reduce the complex relationship between data.</li><br>
       <li>It is used to support manipulation and processing of data.</li><br>
       <li>It is used to provide security of data.</li><br>
       <li>It can view the database from different viewpoints according to the requirements of the user.</li><br>
